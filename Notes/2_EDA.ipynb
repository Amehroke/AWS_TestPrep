Common techniques include **normalization, one-hot encoding, feature scaling, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and interaction terms**.

When we add too many feature vectors, our data moves into a higher-dimensional space. This increases the possible solutions, making the data more sparse, meaning points are farther apart. As a result, models struggle to find meaningful patterns, leading to overfitting and poor generalization. **This is known as the Curse of Dimensionality.**"
